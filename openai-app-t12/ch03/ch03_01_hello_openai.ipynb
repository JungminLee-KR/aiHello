Here’s a simple recipe to make a classic homemade pizza from scratch.\\n\\n### Ingredients\\n\\n#### For the Dough:\\n- 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast\\n- 1 teaspoon sugar\\n- 3/4 cup warm water (110°F / 45°C)\\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)\\n- 1 teaspoon salt\\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\\n\\n#### For the Toppings:\\n- 1/2 cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)\\n- 1 to 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese\\n- Toppings of your choice (pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives, etc.)\\n- Olive oil (for brushing)\\n- Dried oregano or Italian seasoning (optional)\\n\\n### Instructions\\n\\n#### Step 1: Prepare the Dough\\n1. **Activate the Yeast**: In a small bowl, mix the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.\\n  \\n2. **Make the Dough**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Create a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough begins to form.\\n\\n3. **Knead the Dough**: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic. You may need to add a little more flour if the dough is sticky.\\n\\n4. **Let it Rise**: Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Preheat the Oven\\n- Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and if you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well.\\n\\n#### Step 3: Shape the Pizza\\n1. **Punch Down**: Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. \\n\\n2. **Roll Out the Dough**: On a floured surface, roll out the dough to your desired thickness for the pizza. A 10-12 inch diameter is ideal for a standard pizza. \\n\\n3. **Transfer to a Baking Sheet or Pizza Stone**: If you’re using a baking sheet, lightly grease it or sprinkle with cornmeal. If using a pizza stone, you can transfer the dough onto a pizza peel covered with flour before transferring to the stone.\\n\\n#### Step 4: Add Toppings\\n1. **Spread the Sauce**: Evenly spread the pizza sauce over the surface of the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.\\n\\n2. **Add Cheese**: Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce.\\n\\n3. **Add Other Toppings**: Add your favorite toppings evenly over the cheese. \\n\\n4. **Finish with Olive Oil**: Lightly brush the edges of the crust with olive oil for a golden color and sprinkle with dried oregano or Italian seasoning if desired.\\n\\n#### Step 5: Bake the Pizza\\n- Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.\\n\\n#### Step 6: Slice and Serve\\n- Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Slice it into wedges and serve hot!\\n\\n### Enjoy!\\nFeel free to experiment with different sauces, cheeses, and toppings to create your perfect pizza.

      "\n",
      "2. **특유의 조직력과 투지**: 한국 팀은 뛰어난 체력과 조직력을 바탕으로 강팀들을 상대로 놀라운 경기력을 보여주었습니다. 조별 리그에서는 폴란드와 미국을 이기고, 포르투갈과의 16강전에서는 극적인 역전승을 거두었습니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **심판 논란**: 한국의 8강전에서 이탈리아를 상대로 한 경기는 여러 논란을 야기했습니다. 한국이 VAR과 같은 현대적 심판 시스템이 없던 시절에 두 개의 논란 많은 판정을 얻어 승리한 것이었고, 이로 인해 경기 후 이탈리아와 많은 축구 팬들 사이에서 논란이 일었습니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **국민적 열광**: 한국에서 열린 월드컵이라는 특수한 상황으로 인해, 모든 국민이 월드컵에 열광하며, 거리 응원을 했다. 이는 한국 사회 전체의 단결과 공동체 의식을 강화하는 계기가 되었습니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **축구의 대중화**: 한국의 월드컵 성과는 국내 축구의 인기를 끌어올리는 데 크게 기여했습니다. 이후 많은 젊은이들이 축구에 관심을 가지게 되었고, 프로리그와 청소년 축구의 발전에도 도움을 주었습니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "이러한 요소들이 결합하여 2002년 월드컵에서 한국은 역사적인 순간을 만들어냈고, 이는 지금까지도 많은 사람들에게 기억되고 있습니다.\n"
